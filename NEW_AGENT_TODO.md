- Template gallery browsing
- Content generation workflow
- Mobile responsiveness

### 3. Monitor for Issues
- Check browser console for any errors
- Test authentication flow
- Verify Supabase integration is working
- Test AI content generation

### 4. Potential Improvements (if user requests)
- Performance optimizations
- New template categories
- Enhanced mobile experience
- Additional platform integrations
- More AI providers
- Advanced analytics features

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing component patterns
- Keep components small and focused
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### File Organization
- Create new files for new features (don't append to existing large files)
- Use proper folder structure
- Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into services

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load components where appropriate
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Monitor bundle size

## Important Notes

### Supabase Edge Functions
- Functions are automatically deployed when code changes
- Check function logs in Supabase dashboard for debugging
- CORS headers are properly configured

### Mobile Development
- The app is web-based but optimized for mobile browsers
